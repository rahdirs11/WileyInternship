LIBOR: used for pricing of loan and derivative products throught the world.
	Participating banks submitted low or high interest rates according to their derivative
		and trading activites.
	Used in derivative pricing.
	General public fear and outrage - regarding financial security
	$9 bil, fined by Regulators (USA and UK), on the participants of the scam (the global banks) and 
		criminal charges; rate-fixing negatively affected them!
	Example:
		Individual homeowner's mortgage rates went up artificially due to the upward manipulation of 
		LIBOR.
		Financial Conduct Authority(FCA) took the responsibility BBA(Birtish Bankers Asso) 
		and turned it to IBA(Intercontinental Exchange's Benchmark Adminsitration).
		IBA is an independent UK subsidiary of private US based exchange operator, ICE(
		Intercontinental Exchange). 
		LIBOR -> ICE LIBOR 
		New York Federal Reserve launched an alternative to LIBOR in 04-2018 -> SOFR, based on 
		short-term loans in the repo market.
			Makes it a more accurate indicator of borrowing costs.
		SOFR -> based on data from observable transactions.
	ASKING A BANK TO REPORT THEIR BORROWING COSTS, EXPOSES THEIR CREDIT WORTHINESS!

NOT THE RATES AT WHICH BANKS BORROW AND LEND MONEY TO EACH OTHER, 
	BUT THE AVERAGE RATE, DECIDED BY A POOL OF BANKS FOR DIFF CURRENCIES, 
	AND TIME PERIOD, WHAT THEY BELIEVE IT WOULD COST THEM TO BORROW DURING THAT TIME PERIOD


BENCHMARK / REFERENCE INTEREST RATE!
INDIVIDUAL EXPENSES ARE EXPOSED AFTER 3 MONTHS! ANY SHORT TIME CRISIS "WOULD BE" PASSED BY THEN

DERIVATIVE PRICING -> Financial contracts whose value is dependant on underlying asset(s)

REGULATORS -> aka RBI of INDIA

REPO MARKET-> short term borrowing mainly in government securities. Cash on one side, 
	Tresury on the other, two way intersection. 




Result -> Validity of LIBORs validity.
