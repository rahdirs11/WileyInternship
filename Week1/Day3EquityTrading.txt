Market Crash, circuit breakers, impact on macro economy	

A stock market crash is a rapid and often unanticipated drop in stock prices. 
A stock market crash can be a side effect of a major 
catastrophic event, economic crisis, or the collapse of a long-term speculative bubble.

Panic Selling.
	-> Reactionary public panic about a stock market crash can also be a major 
	contributor to it, inducing panic selling that depresses prices even further.

Speculative bubble -> A speculative bubble is a spike in asset values within a particular 
			industry, commodity, or asset class to unsubstantiated levels, fueled by 
			irrational speculative activity that is not supported by the fundamentals.




Circuit Breakers

	The first market-wide circuit breakers were introduced in the U.S. 
	after Black Monday in 1987 when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) 
	declined by 22% in one day.
However, the rules established after Black Monday did not help to prevent the Flash Crash in 2010. 
In February 2013, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced new market-wide circuit 
breakers rules. The S&P 500 index was chosen as the new benchmark, replacing the Dow. The percentage 
decline of the market index is calculated based on the prior-day closing price of the S&P 500.

The market index percentage changes were split into three tiers. Level 1 tier sets up a threshold of 
7% decline, level 2 circuit breaker triggers at a 13% decline, and level 3 sets up a benchmark of a 20% slump. Levels 1 and 2 halt the trading for 15 minutes if a market drop occurs before 3:25 p.m. However, if the decline occurs at or after 3:25 p.m., the trading continues. Level 3 stops the trading 
for the remainder of the trading day in any circumstances.


Lessons learned
-> Don’t fall prey to selling your investments in a panic. 
	Understand the difference between a notional loss and a realized loss. 
-> Avoid the urge to investing in a lump sum and increasing the risk of losses by choosing the 
	wrong investments. Instead, have a slow and steady approach to investing.
-> You will feel the urge to speculate – DON’T! Sick with the basics of investments.
-> Historically, markets have always recovered from crashes and bounced back higher and stronger. 
	Look at the longer-term and adjust your portfolio accordingly.
