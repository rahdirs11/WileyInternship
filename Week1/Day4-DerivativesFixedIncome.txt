Fixed Income -> interests and coupons
	Companies can raise debts from the Capital Market, by issue of Bonds(debunture)
	

	Using bond to raise capital -> 
		Lender/Investor pays par value (quantity * issue price) to purchase the bond
		Issuer repays bond par value plus coupons
		Par Value -> Selling at face value
		Premium -> The difference between face value and selling value (Market price > face value)
		Discount -> Face value < Selling Price

Short term debt
	-> Commerical Paper
	-> US Government Treasury Bills (bond traded at discount): Paid at par value

Repos -> Repurchase agreements

Fractional Requirement -> does it increase in proportion to number of customers
	-> IT is standardized by the central bank -> under the banking reserve act.

Coupons:
	-> Fixed 
	-> Floating 
	-> Zero
